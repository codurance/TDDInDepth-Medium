# Tic Tac Toe Kata - SOLID

## Rules:
* Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on a 3x3 board, with X starting first
* Players cannot play on already taken positions
* A player wins when it has three symbols in a row, either
  - Horizontally
  - Vertically
  - Diagonally
* If all squares are taken and there are not three symbols in a row, than the outcome is a draw

Caveat: try to make invalid state unrepresentable
